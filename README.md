Donation Portal: Secure mechanisms on both platforms for alumni to contribute donations easily and support various initiatives and projects undertaken by the college, fostering a culture of philanthropy. Networking Hub: Dedicated sections on both platforms to connect alumni based on shared interests, professions, and geographic locations, facilitating professional networking, mentorship, and collaboration opportunities. Job Portal: Integrated job search and posting features accessible via web and mobile apps, enabling alumni to explore career opportunities, post job openings, and connect with potential employers within the alumni network. Alumni Directory: Search functionalities available on both platforms to find alumni based on different criteria such as graduation year, field of study, industry, location, etc., promoting networking and community building. Success Story Tracking: Features on both web and mobile apps to showcase and track alumni achievements, success stories, and notable contributions to society, inspiring current students and fostering pride among alumni.

Feedback and Surveys: Channels on both web and mobile apps for alumni to provide feedback on their experiences, suggest improvements, and participate in surveys to help shape future initiatives of the association. The platform will prioritize user experience, security, and scalability across both web and mobile applications to cater to the diverse needs of the Government Engineering College's alumni community. Expected Solution: Implementation of the Alumni Association platform for the Government Engineering College, comprising both web and mobile applications, is expected to achieve several positive outcomes: Enhanced Alumni Engagement: Seamless access to networking, career opportunities, and alumni events through web and mobile apps will strengthen connections among alumni, fostering a vibrant and active community.
